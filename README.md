# NMS Voluntary Challenges
Voluntary self-imposed themes to make *No Man’s Sky* more challenging — and more rewarding.

---

## Purpose
I love this game! It’s my go-to way to throw on some tunes and relax at the end of the day.  
Unfortunately, I find the vanilla experience *way* too easy, and the main storyline doesn’t hold my attention.  

But as an open-world, make-your-own-adventure sandbox, *No Man’s Sky* is unparalleled.  
These are voluntary challenges I use to make the game more engaging and puzzle-like — forcing creative problem-solving instead of relying on convenience systems.

> Above all, the game should be enjoyable!  
> Feel free to adapt any of these to your own playstyle.

## Fundamental Restrictions
All challenge themes start from the same baseline:
- **Permadeath**, with all options set to maximum difficulty.
- **No bases** or base-like structures (e.g., Freighters).
- **No personal teleportation** — only mechanics that teleport ships are permitted.
- **The Space Anomaly** and **Atlas Interface** are restricted.

## Themes

### [The Outlaw’s Path](Outlaws_Path.md)
A detailed fugitive-themed challenge focusing on black-market survival, smuggling, and reputation risk.  
You’ll live as a criminal drifting between Outlaw, Abandoned, and Uncharted systems — buying legitimacy only temporarily.

---

### **The Beggar’s Path**
An ascetic survival mode emphasizing material trade over wealth.

- No use of **currency**: Units, Nanites, or Quicksilver.
- **Direct barter only** — item-for-item exchanges are permitted.

---

### **Living Off the Land (LOL) Challenge**
A nomadic survivalist theme — the game’s economy stripped to its rawest form.

- **Space Stations**, **Trading Posts**, **Colossal Archives**, **Minor Settlements**, and **Freighters** are restricted.
- All **Galactic Trade Terminals** are restricted.

---

### **The Paranoia Challenge**
Total isolation — fear and distrust of every intelligent life form.

- Builds on **Living Off the Land (LOL)**.
- Do **not interact** with any characters (NPCs or players).
- **Avoid inhabited sites entirely**, retreat from or destroy any intelligent life that approachs.

---

## Notes
- Each theme builds on the same **Fundamental Restrictions**.  
- Challenges are designed for personal satisfaction — there are no leaderboards or “correct” playstyles.  
- You can mix and combine themes to create hybrid modes (e.g., *Ronin’s Path* = *Outlaw’s Path* + *Beggar’s Path*).
