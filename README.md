# NMS-Voluntary-Challenges
Voluntary Themes to make the game No Man's Sky more challenging. All themes start with the same base ruleset:
- Permadeath, with all options set to max difficulty.
- No Bases, or base-like structures. e.g. Freighters.
- No personal teleportation. Game mechanics that teleport ships are fine.
- The Space Anomaly and Atlas Interface are restricted.
