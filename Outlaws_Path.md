## Outlaw’s Path Rules

### 1. System Access Restrictions
All inhabited stations and freighters are restricted **except** in the following cases:

- **Outlaw Systems** – Full access permitted.
- **Abandoned Systems** – Access permitted.
- **Uncharted Systems** – Access permitted.
- **Regulated Systems** – Access permitted **only after turning in a Forged Passport**.

#### Forged Passport Protocol
- **Bribe + Money Laundering:**
  - To activate a Forged Passport, spend **1,000,000 Units** at a Trade Terminal on “worthless” material.  
  - This represents the laundering of funds and bribes to secure false identity records.
- Upon leaving the system, all privileges **expire**.
- **Illegal actions immediately revoke privileges.**
- **Forged Passport Limitations:**
  - You may carry **only one** at a time.
  - You may use **only one per Region.**

### 2. NPC Interaction Rules
NPC interactions in **Regulated Systems** are **restricted without a Forged Passport**, except for:

- **Emergency Distress Calls** – May be answered. Surely _they_ wouldn’t turn you in, right?
- **Traveler NPCs** – Permitted. They are not aligned with local authorities and are neutral contacts.

---

### 3. Trade & Contraband Rules
- **Planetary Trade Terminals** are always allowed **only for the purpose of unloading illegal cargo**, even without a Forged Passport.
  - Selling **illegal cargo only**; no selling or purchasing of legal goods without an active Forged Passport.
  - After selling contraband, you must **immediately leave the system.**

---

### 4. Violation Protocol
If you accidentally violate any restriction:

1. **Dump all cargo.**
2. **Destroy all shield modules.**
   - Assume they were damaged while fleeing the system.
3. **Immediately leave the system.**
